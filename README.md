# Lab 6 

This is a contuniaton from the previous lab 5, which where we used the pseudo code that we created in order to help give me an idea on how to code the dataset. this time we wrote the code out using a taxi fare dataset to analyze the distance from pickup to dropoff and to achieve what would be an estimated average fare amount.
